# jamf-scripts

These are some of the scripts that i've used in jamf.
I try to notate where i'm sourcing things from other people as I did not figure all of this out from scratch.
I mostly put things here when I'm using it to answer a post on JamfNation or if it's something I worked really hard on and want to put out there.

I'm not the best about keeping things here up to date as I edit them and update them in my Jamf environment.

Let me know if things need explanation or aren't working for you and I'll try to help.

## script is written by the adamcraig and sourced from https://github.com/theadamcraig/jamf-scripts/sentineone_postinstall.sh


# Unlike other sentinel installs this script will either Install on a new computer OR upgrade if sentinel is already installed. 
#I manage sentinel versions entirely from Jamf and only use one policy for both installs and upgrades.

## MAKE SURE TO ADD IN YOUR TOKEN TO REPLACE "YOURTOKENGOESHERE"

## it's kinda weird because I didn't want two versions. Originally I was packaging up the sentinelagent installer and putting it in /tmp/
## then I just decided to cache it so I didn't need to repackage it, so this script will check both /tmp and the waiting room.

## this will allow the .pkg from sentinel one to be downloaded with out having to be repackaged
## this will also allow me to transition to doing this without needing to have 2 scripts.
